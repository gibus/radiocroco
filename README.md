# radiocroco
Simple GUI and command line script to listen to Radio Croco, free radio from Rennes (France), broadcasted on https://radiocroco.info.

No need to launch a browser to simply listen to Radio Croco, just launch 'radiocroco' to open up a simple dialog window with Play/Stop button and a fancy visualization window displaying psychedelic drawings in reaction to music (based on goom).

Since July, 1st, 2016, broadcast from https://radiocroco.info (instead of mixlr).

Dependencies (for both GUI and console versions):
* perl
* gstreamer-tools
* gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
* libglib-perl
