# radiocroco
Simple GUI to listen to Radio Croco, free radio from Rennes (France), broadcasted on https://pirenaica.fr

No need to launch a browser to simply listen to Radio Croco, just launch 'radiocroco' to open up a simple dialog window with Play/Stop button and a fancy visualization window displaying psychedelic drawings in reaction to music (based on goom).
